# Roadmap

## Completed

- [x] Core MCP tools (recall, store, reward, failure, status)
- [x] Local embeddings with transformers.js
- [x] Repository fingerprinting
- [x] Context-aware scoring
- [x] CLI tool
- [x] Homebrew distribution
- [x] Comprehensive test suite

## Planned

- [ ] **Auto-tagging** - LLM suggests tags based on problem/solution content
- [ ] **Failure prevention** - Proactively warn when approaching known error patterns
- [ ] **Solution merging** - Combine similar solutions into better ones

## Under Consideration

- [ ] **Vector index (HNSW)** - Replace O(n) brute-force search for 10k+ solutions
- [ ] **Solution sharing** - Export/import solutions between team members
- [ ] **Claude Code plugins store** - Official distribution channel

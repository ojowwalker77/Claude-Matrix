## The Win

**How does this help Claude deliver the First Satisfying Answer faster?**

<!-- Be specific. "It would be nice" is not a win. -->

## Current Behavior

<!-- What happens now without this feature? -->

## Proposed Solution

<!-- What should happen? -->

## Estimated Complexity

- [ ] Adds new dependencies

- [ ] Changes database schema
- [ ] Other: ___

## Bloat/Win Assessment

<!--
Remember: Greater bloat = Greater win required

Is this worth it? A 500-line feature for a 5% improvement is probably not.
A 10-line change for a 20% improvement definitely is.

<!-- What else could solve this? Why is your proposal better? -->

## Additional Context

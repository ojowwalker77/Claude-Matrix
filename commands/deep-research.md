# Matrix Deep Research

Perform comprehensive research on a topic using multiple sources: web search, Context7 documentation, Matrix memory, GitHub repositories, and more.

## Usage

Parse the arguments: `$ARGUMENTS`

**Format:** `<query> [depth]`

- **query**: The research topic or question
- **depth** (optional): `quick` | `standard` | `exhaustive` (default: `standard`)

## Depth Levels

- **quick**: Fast research using 2-3 sources, ~500 words output
- **standard**: Balanced research using 4-5 sources, ~1500 words output
- **exhaustive**: Deep research using 6+ sources, ~3000+ words output

## Research Pipeline

### Phase 1: Query Expansion
Analyze the query to:
1. Identify the core topic and intent
2. Generate 2-4 related sub-queries for comprehensive coverage
3. Identify relevant technical domains (frameworks, languages, tools)

### Phase 2: Multi-Source Gathering
Collect information from multiple sources in parallel:

1. **Web Search** (`WebSearch` tool)
   - Search for recent articles, tutorials, and discussions
   - Focus on authoritative sources (official docs, reputable blogs)

2. **Context7 Documentation** (`mcp__plugin_matrix_context7__resolve-library-id` + `mcp__plugin_matrix_context7__query-docs`)
   - If the topic involves a library/framework, query Context7
   - Get up-to-date API documentation and examples

3. **Matrix Memory** (`matrix_recall`)
   - Search for relevant past solutions and patterns
   - Include related failures to avoid

4. **GitHub Repositories** (`matrix_repomix`)
   - For implementation patterns, fetch relevant code from authoritative repos
   - Use Phase 1 to get file suggestions, confirm with user before packing

5. **Additional Sources** (for exhaustive depth)
   - GitHub Issues/Discussions via `gh` CLI
   - Stack Overflow via web search

### Phase 3: Content Fetching
For promising URLs from web search:
1. Use `WebFetch` to retrieve full content
2. Extract key information and code examples
3. Note the source for citations

### Phase 4: Synthesis
Combine all gathered information:
1. Deduplicate overlapping information
2. Organize by subtopic/theme
3. Identify consensus vs. conflicting approaches
4. Highlight best practices and anti-patterns
5. Include relevant code examples

### Phase 5: Output
Generate a polished markdown document:

```markdown
# Research: [Topic]

> Generated by Matrix Deep Research on [date]
> Depth: [quick|standard|exhaustive]

## Summary
[2-3 sentence overview]

## Key Findings
### [Subtopic 1]
[Content with code examples]

### [Subtopic 2]
[Content with code examples]

## Best Practices
- [Practice 1]
- [Practice 2]

## Common Pitfalls
- [Pitfall 1]
- [Pitfall 2]

## Code Examples
[Consolidated, working examples]

## Sources
1. [Source 1](url)
2. [Source 2](url)
...
```

Save to: `~/Downloads/matrix-research-[slug]-[timestamp].md`

## Examples

```
/matrix:deep-research React Server Components best practices standard
/matrix:deep-research "how to implement OAuth 2.0 with PKCE" exhaustive
/matrix:deep-research TypeScript generics quick
```

## Output

After completing research:
1. Display a summary of findings in the chat
2. Report the full markdown file location
3. Offer to elaborate on any section
